## JULIA OMELKO PORTFOLIO

This is a project that I started at the end of the Fall 2021 semester, but just got around to finishing. This is a responsive, mobile-optimized portfolio site for me to display my current work, contact information, and a little about myself.

### DESIGN

1. I like to design things with simple, polished lines and layouts. I wanted the site to focus on myself and my work, so I chose to include my profile picture as soon as you enter, as well as a little blurb, and then the arrow points straight down to my work. Most of the rest of the site's content is pages of my work, as well as a page with contact information, and a little bit about me.


### TROUBLESHOOTING/CHALLENGES

- Since I am not very comfortable with JavaScript yet (but still learning!), I wanted an effect where the content would dynamically reload upon clicking a nav link, but keep the user on the same page. I accomplished a similar effect with only HTML and CSS, by putting an anchor link on each of the secondary nav links, and styling the links to be pink, only on the page the user is currently on.

- The course I took didn't cover mobile optimization, so I took it upon myself to learn about using media queries. Since I made the website as reponsive as possible from the beginning, I didn't need to tweak too much, but I did put in several media queries to change some styling for mobile devices. I used FireFox Developer Tools to ensure it looked as good as possible on many different devices.

- I learned how to make a responsive photo gallery, that could be used with different sized images, as well as how to make the overlays automatically adjust to the different sizes, and I was happy with the result.
